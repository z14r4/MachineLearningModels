# MachineLearningModels
Using knowledge gained from work in DATA100 and IEOR142A at UCB, I am trying to implement multiple types of machine learning models with step-by-step instructions for somebody who might have never seen the subject before. My goal is for someone who's never looked at code before to be able to somewhat parse through the information.
